In broad terms, the water balance is a form of accounting, with a currency of water.  In hydrology, the traditional concept of the water balance begins with precipitation $P$, which falls onto the land surface in the form of either rain or snow.  During a storm event (or a period of significant snowmelt), a portion of the rainfall (snowmelt) will accumulate in nearby streams, rivers, and storm sewers; this portion is commonly termed runoff $R$.  The portion of water that does not runoff remains on the land surface, and generally pools in puddles or is absorbed by the soil.

After the cessation of a storm, the water left behind becomes susceptible to evaporation.  Water in the soil can also be consumed by the roots of vegetation in a process called transpiration.  Hydrologists commonly lump these two processes into one, namely evapotranspiration $E$, which represents the total amount of water lost to the atmosphere.

But not all of the water that remains is lost to the atmosphere; some will continue to percolate deeper underground under the influence of gravity toward the water-table.  This is the water that replenishes groundwater based supplies, and is termed groundwater recharge $G$.  Over the long term, the water balance can be defined as:

$$ 
    P = E + R + G 
$$

Although the above equation appears simple,
